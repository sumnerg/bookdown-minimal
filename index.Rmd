Hi.

Here are some simple edits SG3 made to the orginal template.

And here are some more edits SG3 made.

Maybe someday it will become a full-fledged book.

But a few more changes first.

That's all for now.

No, some more changes.

And still more changes.

And yet still more changes.

<!-- If you need PDF output, uncomment bookdown::pdf_book above in YAML. You will need a LaTeX installation, e.g., https://yihui.name/tinytex/ -->
